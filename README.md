# customer_segmentation_k_means

The Notebook starts with an introduction to clustering and its applications in the business world. Then, it describes the data used in the case study and performs exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand the data.

After EDA, the Notebook explains the K-Means algorithm and its implementation using the scikit-learn library. It then applies K-Means clustering to the customer data and evaluates the results using metrics such as silhouette score and within-cluster sum of squares.

The Notebook concludes with a discussion of the insights obtained from the customer segmentation analysis and recommendations for business strategies based on the segmentation results. Overall, the Notebook provides a detailed and practical example of how to use K-Means clustering for customer segmentation.
